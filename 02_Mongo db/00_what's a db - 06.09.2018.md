# What is a database?

Database is a service in the computer, that knows how to store data , filter data easily,
And enable some accesses at the same time.
Two kinds of data-bases:
1)	Relative database- sql db
2)	No relative database- no sql db
Sql-structured query language
Important: in database we never delete data, instead we will add a colomn named 'isActive' 
type boolean in whitch we will change value to false.

Compare sql-db and no-sql-db hierarchy:

sql:            No-sql:
Data base	    Data-base
tables	        collections
colomns	        -
records	        Document(file)
fields	        properties
